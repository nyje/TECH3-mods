this mod adds various nodes that act like meseblocks (conductable nodes), also some light emitting nodes / lamps, even existing light nodes are added as a mesecon activated version (like meselamp, homedecor lamps)

supported mods for conducting nodes are: default, moreblocks, building_blocks(part of homedecor_modpack), glooptest, gloopblocks, quartz, moretrees, technic, ethereal, moreores, castle



included models and textures are all selfmade and licensed under CC0 / WTFPL, except:

meseconductors_lamp_controller.png which is based on technic_control_logic_unit.png (still WTFPL) from technic modpack

meseconductors_diamond_lamp.* uses default_diamond_block.png, originally by Gambit (CC BY-SA 3.0)
